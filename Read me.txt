This project has 2 attached sample datasets :

- prices.csv: records of product's history price changes in Sep 2018
- sales.csv: records of product's sales in Sep 2018

I will use data wrangling tools to calculate the total revenue of each product at each price. 
The solution will be applicable to similar datasets with large numbers of records.
